## 1. What FinTrack Is
FinTrack is an advisory tool that provides location-specific guidance about fishing conditions and risks. It summarizes available environmental information and translates it into clear advisories for fish species and river locations so users can make better-informed decisions.

## 2. How FinTrack Works
- You enter a state name and a river name.
- The system locates available data for the requested river and nearby monitoring points.
- Data and models are used to assess conditions that affect fish and fishing safety.
- For each species present in the area, FinTrack returns advisory details including a risk zone, explanations, and practical recommendations.

Results are presented as human-readable advisories organized by species and location.

## 3. Understanding Advisory Zones
FinTrack uses three zones to summarize risk:

- **Green — Low risk**
  - Suitable for fishing under normal practices.
  - No major restrictions are recommended.
- **Yellow — Moderate risk**
  - Controlled or restricted fishing is advised.
  - Exercise caution and consider limiting catch or handling.
- **Red — High risk**
  - Temporary closure or minimal fishing is recommended.
  - Avoid fishing in affected areas until conditions improve.

Zones are guidance tools. Local regulations, seasonal rules, and on-site observations take precedence.

## 4. Understanding Advisory Data
Each advisory entry includes fields that explain what is recommended and why:

- **species name**: The fish species the advisory applies to.
- **latitude and longitude**: Approximate coordinates where the advisory applies.
- **zone (Green / Yellow / Red)**: A quick summary of risk and the recommended activity level.
- **risk factors**: Key reasons for the advisory (for example: low dissolved oxygen, high contaminants, algal blooms).
- **fishing advisory**: Plain-language recommendation (for example: "safe to fish", "limit consumption", "avoid harvesting").
- **recommended gear**: Suggested gear or handling practices to reduce harm and exposure.
- **economic note**: Brief remark on potential economic implications for catches or markets.
- **river name**: The river associated with the advisory to avoid confusion when multiple water bodies are nearby.

Use the zone for a quick decision and the supporting fields to understand context and next steps.

## 5. Why This Matters
- **Health**: Advisories reduce exposure to contaminated fish and help prevent foodborne illness.
- **Environmental protection**: Following advisories helps protect vulnerable species and habitats.
- **Livelihoods**: Timely information supports planning for fishers, markets, and local businesses.
- **Resource management**: Advisory data can inform temporary restrictions and recovery actions.

Advisories are decision-support tools and do not replace local rules or professional judgment.

## 6. Data & Technology (High-Level Overview)
- **Data sources**: Environmental measurements (water quality, temperature, oxygen), historical observations, and public datasets where available.
- **Analysis approach**: Statistical and machine-learning methods analyze current and historical data to estimate risk and generate advisories.
- **Limitations**: Advice depends on data availability and quality; sparse or outdated data can lower confidence.
- **Presentation**: Results include a clear zone and explanatory notes so users can judge findings alongside local knowledge.

This is a non-technical summary to explain the role of data and models without detailed algorithms.

## 7. How to Use the Results
- Read the **zone** first for a quick decision: Green, Yellow, or Red.
- Review **risk factors** and the **fishing advisory** to understand why the zone was assigned.
- Check **latitude and longitude** to confirm the advisory applies to your exact location.
- Follow **recommended gear and handling** practices to reduce exposure and environmental impact.
- Consider the **economic note** when planning sales or market activity.
- If the advisory is **Yellow** or **Red**: consult local authorities, avoid large-scale harvesting, and prioritize safety.
- Use advisories as one input: combine them with on-site checks and official regulations before acting.

When in doubt, err on the side of caution and consult local resource managers or public health officials for guidance.
